# zkDAI
A project where we will analyze ways to anonymize crypto currency (such as xDAI) transactions using zero knowledge proofs.

## 1. Step: Understanding smart contracts

To enter the world of crypto-currencies, we have designed our own Smart Contract in Solidity as a first step. 
Our newly invented currency is called "FlensCoin". 
With the help of the [Solidity-IDE "Remix"](https://remix.ethereum.org/) you can test our created contract (flenscoin.sol).
For testing on a test network you will need to install the [MetaMask Chrome extension](metamask.io) which allows using several testing networks.
