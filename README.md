# zkDAI
A project where we will analyze ways to anonymize crypto currency (such as xDAI) transactions using zero knowledge proofs.

## 1. Step: Understanding smart contracts

To enter the world of crypto-currencies, we have designed our own Smart Contract in Solidity as a first step. 
Our newly invented currency is called "FlensCoin". 
With the help of the [Solidity-IDE "Remix"](https://remix.ethereum.org/) you can test our created contract (flenscoin.sol).
For testing on a test network you will need to install the [MetaMask Chrome extension](metamask.io) which allows using several testing networks.

## 2. Step: Setting up a test environment for a fork of xDAI

To get in touch with the implementation of a zero knowledge supported crypto currency, we will try to set up our own test network which can be accessed via MetaMask. As soon as our fork of xDAI is up and running on this network, the next will be implementing zero knowledge transactions.
